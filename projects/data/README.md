# Data

Dataset storage for raw inputs, processed outputs, and model artifacts.

## Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `raw/` | Original platform payloads and scraper outputs |
| `processed/` | Normalized and enriched data |
| `models/` | Model weights and experiment artifacts |

## Guidelines

- Keep raw data immutable
- Include provenance metadata with processed files
- Store only lightweight samples for development

## Status

🚧 *Structure defined — data to be added*
